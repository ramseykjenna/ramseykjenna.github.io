Even before the cohort began, I had an idea of what I wanted to accomplish with my final project. I am fascinated with animals. I love every different kind and each has characteristics that make them extremely interesting. I believe in animal welfare and one of my life's goals is to make a difference any way I can to preserve and protect. As silly as it may sound, the animals in my life have been some of my greatest friends. They are loyal, kind, accepting, and induce feelings of extreme happiness. All of that leads to what I would like my final project to be about. I would like to create a web application that limits the number of homeless pet and pets that find themselves in the shelter by allowing those who unfortunately have to relinquish their beloved pets to find others in their area who are wanting to adopt. This prevents the pets from winding up in the shelter and potentially being put down and being able to move on to a new loving home. Other features would include users being able to filter by pet size/breed and potentially expanding to include other features.
