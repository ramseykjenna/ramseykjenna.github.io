#Week 3 at The Iron Yard: Typographical Discoveries


Words are used to communicate various things…ideas, emotions, feelings…with typography, words can be communicated even more clearly. Different fonts give off different vibes and can emphasize a point to be communicated. It is essential to use the appropriate font or an idea or feeling may not be accurately portrayed. Today we learned about choosing the appropriate font for our restaurant website redesign. My website redesign is for a bakery called Moonlight Bakery. With the name in mind, it could be ideal to use a more modern, somewhat galactic font for the title to go along with the “moonlight” theme. For the rest of the website, a simple modern font would work best for easy readability and to maintain the theme.
