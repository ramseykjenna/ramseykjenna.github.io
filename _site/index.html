                    <h2>UI Designer. Animal Lover. Perpetual Learner.</h2>
                    <p>I am a web designer/developer. I just graduated from The Iron Yard in Austin, TX where I learned all about UI Design. I love recreating websites, making them more user friendly and beautiful. I can also create websites from scratch. I am a fan of simple yet elegant design. </p>

                            <br>
                            <p><b>What was this project about: </b>This was our first project working with an actual client and also with another designer. Our client(REDArena) is a non profit therapeutic riding center in Dripping Springs, TX. Their desire was for us to design a better scheduling system for their center. They are currently using a spreadsheet that gets printed out daily and manually edited when changes take place. At first this system was sufficient for their needs, but as their company is growing, changes are needed to keep up with the demands.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><b>The process: </b>When designing, the first step is research. Researching and documenting what the company is about, what are they seeking in the new design, do they wish to rebrand, how technically proficient are the users, how many employees/riders/horses, etc. We met with the client and discussed a lot of the details before starting anything to get our questions answered and gain a better sense of direction for the web application we were going to build. We also had the developer in the meeting so we were able to better understand their perspective on the build.</p>


                            <br>
                            <p><b>The challenges: </b>One thing I wish I would have done better was keeping track of requirements for the application. Because I had notes and requirements listed and scribbled in several different places, it was hard to stay on track and know what to do next. I definitely need to develop a standard for note taking/staying organized. It felt chaotic without that organization. Another thing that might have added to my confusion, was that it was my first time working with another designer. Naturally each person has their own system for accomplishing a project and it was a great lesson in communication. I think overall we did a great job with that. It was beneficial working with another designer because it drastically decreased my workload, but it was also difficult at times when we didn't agree on certain design elements. Talking through every detail thoroughly and understanding responsibilities before starting was key.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><b>The advantages: </b>The biggest advantage of this process was how much I gained from it. I've heard horror stories from those who have worked with clients directly so I was trepedatious at the beginning. While I'm sure there are some clients out there who aren't the greatest to work with, our client was super great to work with and I had a blast creating something for someone making a difference in the world. I hope that whatever elements of our design they use are beneficial in helping them help others. </p>
