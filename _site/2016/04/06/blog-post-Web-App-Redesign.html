<p>#My process for app redesign(including mental breakdown)</p>

<p>Last weekend our assignment for the Iron Yard was redesigning an app. The website we were given was LinkedIn(we all know it could use some help). My first step was research. I interviewed users and signed up for the app myself. Questions explored include: what do users want more of from LinkedIn, what do users want less of, what is typically a user’s main purpose when logging in to their LinkedIn account, etc. I also explored LinkedIn’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in my research process.</p>

<p>I found that the main reasons for those using the app include the following: to find a job, to connect with those they’ve worked with in the past and make new connections based on people they’ve met or places they could potentially work. Users did not mention feed or following interests other than that it was an unnecessary component of the app. Most users did not use the app until they were seeking new employment opportunities and that it was important to them to see how many views they’ve had when they log in.</p>

<p>After gathering the research, I pondered on what could be the best layout for the app. I decided on a dashboard approach. I found a few examples of great dashboard websites and began sketching a new layout.</p>

<p>After I had a good layout established, I took to Illustrator to create the low fidelity to high fidelity wireframes. This is where things got interesting. Friday night I slacked…come Saturday morning I open Illustrator and it’s at this point I realize, “Wow, I’m an idiot for wasting so much time on pointless crap this weekend…I’m just gonna skip straight to the high fidelity wireframe.” Six hours later…wireframe complete. <strong>Closes laptop</strong> At this point, I waste a few more hours. That evening I return to my computer and open it to get started on the coding portion. My computer restarted, that’s strange. I begin to search the computer for my Illustrator file all the while thinking “I know I saved this…I had to have saved this file”. And then it hit me…I didn’t save my work. Panic sweeps over me and grips my heart. <strong>Commence breakdown</strong> Tears began to flow as I searched my computer again for the file…no luck. Feeling defeated and ultimately down on myself for wasting so much time instead of tending to my weekend project, I cried for a bit and then set out to recreate the wireframe from scratch. I start building out the app on Sunday morning and remember I have to get my sister from the airport. I rush to the airport, pickup my chatty sister, and agree to get lunch. Upon returning, as I open the door to my apartment I am hit with the most repugnant odor my nose has ever smelled. Taking up the space of the entire kitchen floor as well as the pantry and refrigerator door is a puddle of diarrhea. Shit. Literally. I look up to see a very guilty dog cowering on the other end of the apartment. After taking him outside where he let loose even more diarrhea, I return to the apartment and set to cleaning the mess.</p>

<p>At this point I am exhausted and discouraged and still haven’t started on the hardest part of my project. After the mess was clean and I could breath again, I began building the app.
To get this story wrapped up, I ended up having a mental breakdown at 3am after trying for an hour to figure out something that should’ve taken 15 minutes. I procrastinated, ran into a few hurdles, and made the project harder than it needed to be by doing so. I skipped steps that are intended to be there to make it easier, such as setting up a grid system before building out the other code.</p>

<p>Good news is, I received a lot of positive feedback on my wireframe. Bad news is, I still haven’t finished building out the app. This weekend was a wake up call that I needed to get back in the right mindset to finish out this cohort. Six more weeks to go!!</p>
